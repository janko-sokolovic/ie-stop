# IE STOP!

How many hours have you wasted hacking an already working solution to also work on ie?

This tool is used to make ie completely obsolete. For every project you use, add this tiny package which will 'motivate' the user to switch to another browser.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i --save ie-stop
$ yarn add ie-stop
```

## Usage

```js
import ieStop from 'ie-stop';

ieStop();
```

It is still in early phase, so feel free to contribute and add new looks/messages/description for the user as in why is ie so awful.

Advantages:
- less time wasted on developing ie compatibility -> more new features sooner
- security issues mitigated
- ugly animations - users will enjoy web more
- no more missing features/animations due to IE
